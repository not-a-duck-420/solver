## Installing dependencies
 The python script used to convert the private key into a wallet address requires you have web3 installed.
 To install on a mac run the following command in terminal:
 > pip install web3

## Installation
Just download and save into a folder somewhere or run the following in terminal:
> git clone not-a-duck-420/solver

## Running
In terminal, navigate to the folder using the command:
> cd path/to/folder

Then run the script by typing
> Rscript app.R

The first time you run it it may ask for permission to access your google documents and you should be prompted through your web browser.
After that's done, it should say something like:
"Listening on http://127.0.0.1:7641"

Go to that address in your web browser.
